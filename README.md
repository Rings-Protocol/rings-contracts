# Rings

Rings is a meta-stablecoin for USD & ETH offering competitive yield for stakers, providing deep liquidity for Sonic DeFi, and funding Sonic DeFi projects via its lockers.  
Rings is build on top of Ethereum vaults, allowing to emit an asset (scUSD & scETH) on the Sonic chain.  
Those assets can be staked, and the share token received by staking can then be locked inside veNFTs, forfeiting the staking rewards.  
Those veNFTs give holders the right to vote on weekly gauge votes to allocate the yield from Ethereum vaults to listed Sonic ecosystem projects.
